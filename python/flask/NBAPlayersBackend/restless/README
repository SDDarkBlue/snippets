Tested the use of the Flask-restless extension. Voor constructing a API for basic querying of a dataset, this extension is really great. However, for the given dataset (NBA players and game stats), I could not find an easy was to implement an end point that allows me to query for average stats per game. Flask-restless seems unsuitable for performing queries that involve calculations and return the results.
